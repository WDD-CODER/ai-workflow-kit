# Run log

One row per orchestrator run, written by `node scripts/orch-state.mjs finish` from the run's `status.json` — never by hand. `orch-readiness` reads the last three rows (a reason that parked a plan in two of them is asked about before the run starts), and the run report ends with a trend line from them (`node scripts/orch-state.mjs trend`). The `✗` columns of a run are filled by the next `finish`, from `decision-log.md` (a log row belongs to the run whose plan list holds its plan number); the newest run's stay `-` until then. The table keeps the 20 newest rows; older ones are rolled into one `Earlier (N runs): …` line above it.
